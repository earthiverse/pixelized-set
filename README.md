# Pixelized-set
This is a GIMP plug-in I made to generate a set of pixelized images for use in "What's this?" type of PowerPoint presentations/games for ESL classes.

## Example
Look at the sample image in the input folder. The script, if used as-is, will output a set of images like the ones in the output folder.

The sample image is sourced from https://www.irasutoya.com/2013/05/blog-post_5956.html, and is copyright Takashi Mifune.

## Install
Copy `pixelized-set.py` to the plug-in folder for GIMP. Check out https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins for more information on how to do this.

## How to use
1. Launch GIMP
2. File -> Open, and choose the picture you'd like to pixelize
3. Filters -> Generate Pixelized Set
4. Select the output directory, the output height, and the square sizes.
5. Click OK.
